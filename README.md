# Jets Project

## Description
This project is a fleet of Jet objects. Jets can have Pilots.

## Topics Covered

* Object-oriented design
* Inheritance
* Arrays
* UML

## Objectives

The main objective of this assignment was to get practice with methods, classes and object oriented programming. Below are the specific requirements for this project.

* There is a menu with 5 options:

List fleet
View fastest jet
View jet with longest range
Add a jet to Fleet
Quit

* List fleet prints out the model, speed, range, and price of each jet. (There must be at least 5 jets stored when the program starts).


*The view fastest jet and longest range options both print out all of the information about their jets.

*Quit exits the program.

*A user can add custom jets to the fleet.

###Stretch Goals

*Each jet has a pilot

*Assign a random pilot to each jet that is created

*Users can hire pilots

*Whenever a jet's information is displayed, that jet's pilot and his/her information should also be displayed

## Program Basics
This program is pretty simple to operate. It begins with a 6 option menu (the 6th being a way to hire pilots). 

If you select the first option, you will see all the jets in the fleet.

If you select the second option, you will see all the information on the jets that are the fastest, all of them.

If you select the third option, you will see all the information on the jets that have the longest range.

The fourth option will allow you to add a jet. If you are short pilots you will be prompted to hire a pilot. All pilots are randomly assigned. The new pilot will take an old pilots position, and that pilot will become the pilot of the new plane.

The fifth option allows you to quit.

The sixth option allows you to just hire a pilot.
